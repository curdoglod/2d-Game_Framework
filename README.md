# 2D Game Framework

*A lightweight 2D game framework developed in C++ with a focus on modularity and extendibility, using the SDL2 library.*

## Features

- **Entity-Component System (ECS)**: A flexible architecture using an entity-component system to improve code organization and expandability.
- **Modular Components**: Includes predefined components such as `Button`, `Image`, `Rigidbody`, and `Text` for creating user interfaces, visual elements, and managing physics.
- **Rendering and Sprites**: Supports working with sprites through the `Image` class, which allows for loading and rendering textures and images.
- **Input Handling**: The `Button` component handles mouse click and movement events, enabling the creation of interactive UI elements.
- **Scene Management**: The `SceneManager` automates object storage and cleanup, simplifying state management and transitions between game scenes.
- **Event-Driven System**: Event handling, such as mouse button clicks or key presses, is implemented for more interactive control.
- **Event Distribution**: Components can react to events like clicks or movements without tight coupling between them.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **CMake**: The project uses CMake to handle building and dependencies.
- **SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, Minizip**: Install these libraries for additional functionalities.
